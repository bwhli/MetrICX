<h1><strong>Core Features</strong></h1>

MetrICX allows you to track and view your own staking data, vote allocation, current i_Score, projected returns, and other information all from your mobile phone. Meanwhile, future releases will include additional features such as push notifications regarding P-Rep productivity, I_Score availability, and P-Rep announcements.

While much of this data is readily available through the ICONex Chrome extension, accessing it requires logging in either via your computer or with cold storage. MetrICX allows you to view this data without requiring any such login.

Simply input your public wallet address into MetrICX, and you'll be able to view:

 **Available Balance** - The total amount of liquid ICX held in your wallet at that moment. This figure does not include currently-staked ICX, as it is not liquid.

**Un-staking Period** - The number of days you have remaining before being able to access your ICX if you've elected to un-stake.

**Staked** - The total amount of ICX you've staked in this wallet.

**Total & Unclaimed ICX** - This figure includes the total amount of ICX you own (both liquid and staked), as well as the total amount of ICX that is currently unclaimed in the form of your I_Score. This way, you can view how much ICX is waiting for you without having to login to your wallet to check.

**Staking Overview** - View the projected amount of ICX you'd generate via compound interest at the current reward rate. Currently, this is calculated on a weekly basis, but presented as a monthly figure.

**Reward Summary** - View the total rewards you're projected to receive for the year at the current reward rate, which is also present in this section. This section also displays the current "un-stake period" for the network, indicating how many days you'd need to wait before being able to access your ICX if you decide to un-stake.

**Staking Distribution** - View a visual representation of your allocated delegation toward P-Rep candidates.

**Governance Overview** - View the current status of the P-Reps you have voted for. This includes their productivity ratio, total vote allocation, and vote % among all ICONists as well as the number of ICX currently staked and % of network staked, as well as the current number of P-Rep candidates.

**Push Notifications** - 
  * MetrICX provides users with the option of receiving push notifications when their I_Score has been made available for a given day,     and the amount of I_Score they are receiving in the form of ICX.
  * MetrICX provides users with the option of recieved push notifications when an ICX or IRC-2 token deposit has been recieved
  * MetrICX provides uers with the option to recieve push notificatins when an elected main prep has dropped node productivity.
